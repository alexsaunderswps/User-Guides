# Library Management Guide

## Purpose & Context
This guide provides the required steps to install the WildXR application and remove or hide unwanted VR applications. 
Meta VR headsets automatically install numerous social media apps that may be undesirable in a public setting.

⚠️ **Third Party Software**: Third Party hardware and software (Meta, ArborXR) are outside WPS control. Meta updates may cause unexpected functionality changes in VR systems. WPS monitors Meta and ArborXR releases to inform users of potential impacts and changes.

## Prerequisites
- A WiFi internet connection
- VR headsets

## Quick Overview (for experienced users)
1. Install the WidXR application
2. Open the Library on the VR headset
3. Lock undesired applications *(even if you will be removing or hiding applications, WPS recommends locking all extraneous apps)*

## Troubleshooting

**Unable to find WildXR application:**
- Ensure that you are searching in the Store not the Library
- Verify the spelling of WildXR 
- Check your connection to the internet

**WildXR application fails to download:**
- Verify your headset is connected to the internet
- Low bandwidth or unstable internet can influence the ability to download application

**Unable to find Passcode & Security settings:**
- Ensure that you have scrolled the left-hand menu in the Settings panel
- Enter **Passcode** in the search box in the left-hand menu and select **Passcode & Security**

**A passcode is required to launch WildXR:**
- WildXR has been locked and will need to be unlocked
- Follow the steps to **Lock Undesired Applications** - Step #6
- Unlock the WildXR application by changing the toggle
- Attempt to launch the application to confirm that WildXR has been unlocked

**A certain application can not be uninstalled**
- Meta prevents the removal of certain applications
- These applications should be locked and hidden to minimize the opportunities for abuse

**A certain application can not be hidden**
- Meta may remove the ability to hide certain, or all, applications
- These applications should be locked to minimize the opportunities for abuse
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Many applications are visible in the Library panel**
- Meta automatically installs, or makes visible, various applications
- WPS cannot prevent the display or installation of certain applications
- Follow the steps to **Lock**, **Uninstall**, and **Hide** applications
- Forcing WildXR to auto-launch will remove some opportunity to abuse the VR system

**Unable to unlock applications once locked**
- WPS Staff are unable to recover a forgotten Passcode
- Ensure that Passcodes are kept in a secure location or Password management application
- Use a memorable, but not overly simple, passcode to lock applications
- A factory reset will be necessary to restore access to apps if a Passcode has been lost

## Important Security Notes

⚠️ **Securing your Headset**: Remove access to hand controllers, auto-launch the WildXR application, monitor headset use throughout the day.

⚠️ **Headset monitoring**: WPS recommends checking VR headsets daily for unauthorized tampering (installing applications or changing settings).

⚠️ **Restrict Internet Connectivity**: Restricting Internet connectivity will remove some functionality in managing your headset through the WildXR web portal.

⚠️ **Meta Store Access**: Meta prevents locking, hiding, and uninstalling the Meta Store application. 

⚠️ **Additional Security**: Options for further securing the VR experience are available, but add cost and complexity to headset use. Contact WPS staff for more information.

⚠️ **Account Recovery**: WPS Staff have access to only certain credentials for your Meta account. Always secure your access codes somewhere safe.
