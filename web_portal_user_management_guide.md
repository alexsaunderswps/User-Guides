## Troubleshooting

**Unable to Log In to Wildxr.org:**
- Double check your log in credentials
- Check your internet connection
- If there is another user in your organization, have them update password and check username
- Contact WPS if Log In continues to fail

**New user is unable to log in to Wildxr.org:**
- New users need to have an initial password set by an exisiting user via the **"Update Password"** - see Step 5
- Double check the credentials provided to the new user
- Ensure that the new user appears on the User page for your organization

**Expected Users are not visible:**
- Ensure you are logged in to the correct account
- Ensure that the user belongs to your organization
- Log out of the WildXR web portal and log back in

**Unable to change user organization:**
- Organization Admin users cannot change organization assignment for users

**Unable to change user role:**
- Organization Admin users cannot change role assignment for users

**Unable to create a new user:**
- Ensure that the username has not been used in your organization
- Ensure that the email address has not been used in your organization
- Conect WPS if user creation continues to fail

## Important Notes

⚠️ **WPS Staff can not recover your password**: WPS staff can update, but not recover your password if you lose it.

⚠️ **Email addresses must be unique**: If a group email has been used for a user in your organization (info@yourorganization.org), it cannot be used for a new user.

⚠️ **Usernames must be unique**: Usernames cannot be reused within an organization.

## Verification Steps

Verify that your user creation or updates have been successful.

**Complete functionality verification:**
- Log out of the Wildxr.org Web Portal
- Attempt to Log In as the recently created or updated user
