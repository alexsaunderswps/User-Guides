## Troubleshooting

**App shows "All devices greyed out":**
- Plugs have lost internet connection
- Check local internet connectivity
- Contact WPS if multiple plugs affected

**Cannot log in:**
- Verify Gmail address is correct for VR setup
- Request password reset assistance from WPS
- Ensure using correct account (work vs. personal)

**Schedules not working:**
- Check that schedule toggle switches are enabled
- Verify plug has internet connection (not greyed out)
- Confirm time zone settings in app

**Plug appears offline:**
- Check physical power to plug location
- Verify WiFi connectivity at plug location
- Try manual power cycle of plug

## Power Management Best Practices

**Daily Operations:**
- Schedule computers to start before facility opens
- Schedule headset charging during off-hours
- Allow cool-down time for equipment

**Troubleshooting Mode:**
- Use manual override when schedules aren't working
- Power cycle equipment by turning off for 30 seconds
- Coordinate with WPS before changing existing schedules

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Password Coordination**: Always coordinate password changes with WPS staff. Independent changes may lock out technical support.

⚠️ **Schedule Dependencies**: Some equipment requires specific power-up sequences. Consult WPS before modifying complex schedules.

⚠️ **Offline Impact**: Plugs without internet connection cannot be controlled remotely and will not follow schedules.

## Account Security
- Multiple staff members can access the same Kasa account
- Each person should install the app on their own device
- Login credentials remain the same across all devices
- Report suspected unauthorized access to WPS immediately

## Next Steps
- Document your facility's plug naming conventions
- Note optimal power schedules for your operation hours
- Establish backup procedures for when plugs go offline
- Create staff training for basic plug operations
