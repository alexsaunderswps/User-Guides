## Troubleshooting

**Unable to log onto the Wildxr.org website:**
- Ensure you are entering the correct credentials to log into Wildxr.org *(May have been supplied by WPS Staff)*
- If someone within your organization created your account; check that they assigned a password to your account *(passwords are not created automatically)*
- Double-check the URL you have entered into your Web Browser *(WPS recommends using Chrome)*

**WildXR web portal not accepting thumbnail:**
- Ensure that the image file you are attempting to use is saved as a .PNG
- Image file formats other than .PNG will not be accepted by the WildXR web portal.
- *Most image editing programs allow users to save images in a variety of formats, including .PNG*
- Open the image file in an image editor and choose **"Save As"** to save a .PNG version of your image

**No YouTube URL exists for the video:**
- Videos in the WildXR application do not require a **YouTube URL** to function.
- **YouTube URL** entries assist with sorting videos by popularity and viewing frequency

**Error when entering the YouTube URL:**
- Only the last 11 characters (characters after the equal (=) sign) of the **YouTube URL** should be entered

**Unable to select organization assignment for video:**
- The **Organization** field is auto-populated to match your organization if you are logged in as an **Organization Admin** 
- Only **System Admin** users can choose **Organization** assignment for videos from a list.
- If you believe you need to assign a video to an **Organization** other than your own, please contact WPS staff.

**Wrong organization is auto-selected during video creation:**
- Ensure you are logged into the WildXR web portal using the correct account
- Contact WPS staff if the auto-selected organization does not match your account organization
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Unable to find correct country for video details:**
  - Begin typing the name of the country you are trying to select, the **Countries** field will auto-suggest valid selections
  - If the **Country** is not present in the drop-down menu, contact WPS staff with a request to update the current **Country** database.

**Unsure of the correct video format to select:**
- For most traditional videos **2D Standard Format** is the correct option
- For videos filmed with 360° cameras, **Standard 360** is the correct option
- **Stereographic** videos are filmed with specialized cameras, typically using dual lenses to capture depth, these are less common than 2D and 360° videos
- **Standard 180**, also known as SBS (Side-by-Side) videos offer a 180° view to the view, these are less common than 2D and 360° videos
- Video format selection will affect the playback of your video in the WildXR application, but can be changed after review if results are not as expected
- Video format selection does not affect how a video is uploaded or encoded for playback

**Unsure of the correct video resolution to select:**
- **Video Resolution** is currently used only for categorization of videos, it will not affect the playback quality of the video
- Select **4k** if you are uncertain of the correct **Video Resolution** designation

**Correct video resolution is not offered in drop-down menu:**
- **Video Resolution** is currently only used for categorization and will not affect the playback of your video
- Select the nearest value to your video's resolution
- If you believe more resolution options should be available, please contact WPS staff

**Species unavailable in drop-down menu:**
- If your video contains a species not currently represented within the WildXR application video library a new species entry will need to be created
- To prevent duplicate species, species creation is currently restricted to WPS staff
- Please contact WPS staff so that an appropriate species entry can be created
- You may use the **Various** species placeholder to allow video creation to continue in the meantime

**Core Map Marker does not exist:**
- **Core Map Markers** are map markers created by WPS and provided to all **Organizations** using the WildXR application
- If WPS does not currently have video content for a location no map marker will be available
- Create a **Custom Map Marker** for your organization's private use
- **Video Catalogues** can use a combination of **Core Map Markers** and **Custom Map Markers** 
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Icon not available for Custom Map Marker:**
- The icons available for **Custom Map Markers** were selected to cover a wide range of uses
- These icons must meet certain requirements to display properly in the WildXR application in a VR setting

**Video is not ready for upload:**
- To upload a video at a later time follow the **Edit an existing video** workflow starting at Step #20

**Video not accepted for upload:**
- Videos must be in either **.mp4** or **.mov** format for uploading to the WildXR system
- Ensure your video is one of these two formats before uploading to the WildXR portal
- You must have a strong internet connection to successfully upload a video

**Error when uploading video:**
- Ensure you are attempting to upload the proper format video file (either **.mp4** or **.mov**)

**Closed video encoding screen before encoding completed:**
- Video encoding continues in the background once a video has been successfully uploaded and the **Encode Video** button has been pressed
- Encoding time depends on video file size and could take 60 minutes or longer for long videos
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Video not available in WildXR application:**
- There are multiple reasons why an existing video is not showing in the WildXR application
- Videos created by an **Organization** other than **WildXR** are only visible to that **Organization**
- Ensure that you are logged in as the correct **Organization** and that the **Device** and **Installation** are also associated with the correct organization
- Make sure that **Video Upload** and **Video Encoding** have completed before checking an **Installation** for your video
- Ensure that the video has been added to a **Video Catalogue** - see the **Web Portal Video Catalogue Creation Guide**
- Ensure that the **Video Catalogue** is being used in an **Installation** - see the **Web Portal Installation Management Guide**
- Make sure that the **Installation** has been assigned to a registered **Device** - see the **Web Portal Device Management Guide**
- Make sure that, if the video contains adult subject matter (has the **Tags** - "Carcass", "Graphic..." assigned to it), the **Show Graphic Sex** or **Show Graphic Death** checkboxes have been selected
- While it is possible to use videos that have not been assigned to a **Map Marker** in a **Video Catalogue**, this can result in a video being difficult to find
- Check in the **All Clips** gallery of your **Installation**
- If your video is still not visible please contact WPS staff for further assistance

**Video playback poor or has errors:**
- Videos not downloaded are streamed from the cloud
- Streamed video quality depends on a strong and fast internet connection
- WPS recommends downloading all videos for playback, and for assessing the quality of a video in 360° VR
- Video quality is impacted by various production and encoding settings outside of the WildXR environment - assess all videos for quality prior to uploading to the wildxr.org system
- Errors may be caused by weak or intermittent internet during video download
- Follow the **Video file Transfer Guide** to find the location of downloaded files on the VR Device - copy the video file to a computer to play outside of a VR device to assess quality

**Video accidentally deleted or replaced:**
- Unfortunately WPS staff can not recover deleted or overwritten videos
- WPS recommends keeping a persistent video database of past video versions for such an eventuality

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Video Upload:** Video upload success and time to completion depend on a strong and stable internet connection. 

⚠️ **Video upload to video encoding:** Users should not navigate away from the **Video Upload** page until the page shows the video upload has completed and that the video is ready for **Encoding.** Opening other browser tabs will not interrupt a video upload, but leaving the upload page to navigate elsewhere on the wildxr.org website will necessitate uploading the video again. Once **Encoding** has begun the user will automatically be taken to the **Videos** page.

⚠️ **Unable to recover replaced or deleted videos:** WPS staff cannot recover deleted or overwritten video files.

⚠️ **Video Playback:** Video playback quality is impacted by many factors. Review the steps above and contact WPS staff if quality is still less than expected.
