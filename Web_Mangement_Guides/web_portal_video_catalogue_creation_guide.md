   - To **"Edit"** an existing catalogue, continue to Step 8

### Add a new video catalogue

4. **Name, Overview, and Organization**
   - On the **Video Catalogues** page click the **"+ Add"** button in the top right
   - In the **"Name"** field, enter the **Video Catalogue** name - *This name is used for organization and assignment on the WildXR web portal only and is not visible to the users*
   - In the **"Overview"** field enter a brief description of the **Video Catalogue**
   - *This **Overview** is used internally for organization and is not shown to the user*

   - *If you are a **System Admin** select the appropriate **Organization** from the drop-down menu*
   - Click the **"Next"** button

### Add markers to a catalogue

5. **Add core and custom map markers**
   - ⚠️*Adding a **Map Marker** to your catalogue will automatically add all videos contained in that marker to the catalogue as well - if you want a subset of videos from a marker, you will need to deselect the videos you do not want included in your catalogue*⚠️
   - Select the **"Core Map Markers"** for the catalogue by clicking the appropriate checkboxes
   - **"Core Map Markers"** are curated by WildXR staff and are available to everyone
   - *Use the **"Select All Map Markers"** checkbox to quickly select all **Core Map Markers***
   - ⚠️*Map Marker selection determines which videos are available for your catalogue*
   - ⚠️*If you select no map markers - all videos produced by your organization or WildXR are available for assignment to your catalogue*
   - ⚠️*If you select map markers - only videos produced by your organization or WildXR, **and** associated with the selected markers - are available to be used in the catalogue*
   - Click the **"Custom Map Marker"** tab to show markers associated with your organization
   - Select the markers for the catalogue by clicking the appropriate checkboxes
   - ⚠️*Be mindful of the number of markers selected for a catalogue as too many markers are visually unappealing to users in the WildXR application*
   - ⚠️*Remember that Map Markers can overlap which can make them unresponsive to user interaction - always check your catalogue prior to using it in public facing VR experiences*
   - Click the **"Next"** button
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Associate videos with your catalogue

6. **Add videos**
   - Check the box in the upper left corner of each video you want included in the **Video Catalogue** contents
   - Use the **Search** function to narrow down the videos presented for inclusion
   - Use the **Pagination** interface (page numbers) in the lower right to see more videos and add them to your catalogue
   - *Videos will only show in the **Map Marker** to which they are assigned, or in the **All Clips** and **Short Films** galleries if the **Menu Tray** is visible in your **Installation**
   - ⚠️*A **Video Catalogue** is a snapshot of content when it is created - updates to **Core Map Markers** and **Custom Map Markers** will not update within an existing **Video Catalogue** ⚠️
   - When you have finished adding videos to your catalogue, click the **"Next"** button
   - *If you are an **Organization Admin** you will only see videos associated with your organization and those by the WildXR team*
   - *If you are a **System Admin** you will see all videos across all organizations*
   - ⚠️*A **System Admin** should not add videos from different organizations to a catalogue unless that catalogue is for WildXR team use*
   - ⚠️*Adding videos from different organizations to an organization's **Video Catalogue** can cause confusion and prevents the owning organization from removing that video during editing*

## Troubleshooting

**Unable to log onto the Wildxr.org website:**
- Ensure you are entering the correct credentials to log into Wildxr.org *(May have been supplied by WPS Staff)*
- If someone within your organization created your account; check that they assigned a password to your account *(passwords are not created automatically)*
- Double-check the URL you have entered into your Web Browser *(WPS recommends using Chrome)*

**Unable to assign catalogue to correct organization:**
- If you are logged in as an **Organization Admin** you will not be able to change the organization assignment for the video catalogue
- Log out and log back in as a different user, or as a **System Administrator** to change the organization assignment if needed
- If you believe you need access to a different organization please contact WPS staff.

**Unwanted videos remain in catalogue:**
- Adding a **Map Marker** to a catalogue automatically adds all videos within that marker to the catalogue
- Catalogue contents must be curated by either adding (checking) or removing (unchecking) the checkbox in the video thumbnail top left corner
- If a video remains in your video catalogue after being deselected (unchecked) please contact WPS staff for assistance
- ⚠️*If you are a **System Admin** and you include **Map Markers** from a variety of organizations in a catalogue, you may create a situation where an **Org Admin** cannot see videos or markers on the wildxr.org website, but those markers or videos are visible in a WildXR application **Installation***⚠️ 
- ⚠️*As a **System Admin** you should avoid including markers or videos from different organizations - the exception is WildXR produced content*
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Video catalogue does not include newly produced video:**
- **Video Catalogues** act as a snapshot of content from the moment they are created and will not automatically update when new content is added
- To include new content in a catalogue you must refresh **Map Marker** content by removing and then adding again the marker, or adding the marker if it was not already included in the catalogue
- Ensure that you have added the new content (video) to a **Map Marker** and that the **Map Marker** is also included in the **Video Catalogue**
- If the **Video** that is missing contains adult content (gore/death or reproductive behavior), make sure that you have the appropriate filters set in either the device **Installation** or in the **Device** itself

**Video catalogue missing WildXR video since updating Map Markers**
- **Video Catalogues** act as a snapshot of content from the moment they are created and will not automatically update when new content is added
- If WildXR staff removed a video from a **Core Map Marker** - a marker created by WildXR - that video will be removed from a catalogue if that marker is updated
- If you believe your catalogue requires the video in question, please reach out to WPS staff

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Video Catalogues are a snapshot**: Catalogues are a snapshot of Map Markers and Videos when they were created. Updates to videos and markers may not automatically be applied to existing catalogues. Follow the recommendations in step #13 to refresh marker contents in an existing catalogue.

⚠️ **Smaller catalogues are more flexible**: While it may be tempting to have one, large catalogue, it is often better to have more, smaller catalogues, to apply to **Installations**. Smaller catalogues are easier to maintain and keep track of. Unless you are routinely using all the videos in a catalogue, target you catalogues to cover 3 or 4 different **Installations** and streamline them for easier maintenance.

⚠️ **Map Markers can overlap**: Overlapping Map Markers are difficult for users to interact with. Verify that Map Markers are separated with no overlap before deploying your markers to a publicly used Catalogue or Installation.

⚠️ **Markers without downloaded videos will not show in WildXR when offline**: If a device is offline, map markers will not show if they do not contain any downloaded videos. Reconnect to the internet or sideload the needed videos to have WildXR show the marker in question.

## Verification Steps

Verify that your video catalogue creation or updates have been successful.

**Complete functionality verification:**
- Log out of the Wildxr.org Web Portal
- Log in and refresh the **Video Catalogues** page to ensure your catalogue appears as expected
- Assign your **Video Catalogue** to an **Installation**
- Assign that **Installation** to a registered **Device** and connect that device to the internet
- Launch WildXR and confirm that the **Catalogue** shows the **Map Markers** and **Videos** as expected
