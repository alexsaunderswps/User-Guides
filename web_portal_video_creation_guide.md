## Important Notes

⚠️ **Developer Privileges Required**: Your Meta account must have developer access granted by WPS before MQDH will function properly for custom app installation.

⚠️ **Account Consistency**: The Meta account used in MQDH must exactly match the account associated with your VR headsets. Mixed accounts will prevent proper device recognition.

⚠️ **Security Coordination**: Never modify developer settings or install unauthorized applications without WPS approval. This can compromise headset security and void support agreements.

⚠️ **System Requirements**: MQDH requires modern computer specifications and may not work properly on older or resource-limited systems.

## Verification Steps

Verify that your MQDH application is capable of recognizing, connecting to, and managing VR headsets without additional configuration steps.

**Complete functionality verification:**
- MQDH launches without errors and displays account information correctly
- At least one headset appears as "Active" in the devices list
- USB debugging authorization has been granted and confirmed
- Device management icons are accessible and responsive in the left sidebar
- You can access the headset's file system and application management features
