## Troubleshooting

**Unable to log onto the Wildxr.org website:**
- Ensure you are entering the correct credentials to log into Wildxr.org *(May have been supplied by WPS Staff)*
- If someone within your organization created your account; check that they assigned a password to your account *(passwords are not created automatically)*
- Double-check the URL you have entered into your Web Browser *(WPS recommends using Chrome)*

**WildXR web portal not accepting thumbnail:**
- Ensure that the image file you are attempting to use is saved as a .PNG
- Image file formats other than .PNG will not be accepted by the WildXR web portal.
- *Most image editing programs allow users to save images in a variety of formats, including .PNG*
- Open the image file in an image editor and choose **"Save As"** to save a .PNG version of your image

**No Youtube URL exists for the video:**
- Videos in the WildXR application do not require a **Youtube URL** to function.
- **Youtube URL** entries assist with sorting videos by popularity and viewing frequency

**Error when entering the Youtube URL:**
- Only the last 11 characters (characters after the equal (=) sign) of the **Youtube URL** should entered

**Unable to select organization assignment for video:**
- The **Organization** field is auto-populated to match your organization if you are logged in as an **Organization Admin** 
- Only **System Admin** users can choose **Organization** assignment for videos from a list.
- If you believe you need to assign a video to an **Organization** other than your own, please contact WPS staff.

**Wrong organization is auto-selected during video creation:**
- Ensure you are logged into the WildXR web portal using the correct account
- Contact WPS staff if the auto-selected organization does not match your account organization

**Unable to find correct country for video details:**
  - Begin typing the name of the country you are trying to select, the **Countries** field will auto-suggest valid selections
  - If the **Country** is not present in the drop-down menu, contact WPS staff with a request to update the current **Country** database.

**Unsure of the correct video format to select:**
- For most traditional videos **2D Standard Format** is the correct option
- For videos filmed with 360° cameras, **Standard 360** is the correct option
- **Stereographic** videos are filmed with specialized cameras, typically using dual lenses to capture depth, these are less common than 2D and 360° videos
- **Standard 180**, also known as SBS (Side-by-Side) videos offer a 180° view to the view, these are less common than 2D and 360° videos
- Video format selection will affect the playback of your video in the WildXR application, but can be changed after review if results are not as expected
- Video format selection does not affect how a video is uploaded or encoded for playback

**Unsure of the correct video resolution to select**
- **Video Resolution** is currently used only for categorization of videos, it will not affect the playback quality of the video

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Developer Privileges Required**: Your Meta account must have developer access granted by WPS before MQDH will function properly for custom app installation.

⚠️ **Account Consistency**: The Meta account used in MQDH must exactly match the account associated with your VR headsets. Mixed accounts will prevent proper device recognition.

⚠️ **Security Coordination**: Never modify developer settings or install unauthorized applications without WPS approval. This can compromise headset security and void support agreements.

⚠️ **System Requirements**: MQDH requires modern computer specifications and may not work properly on older or resource-limited systems.

## Verification Steps

Verify that your MQDH application is capable of recognizing, connecting to, and managing VR headsets without additional configuration steps.

**Complete functionality verification:**
- MQDH launches without errors and displays account information correctly
- At least one headset appears as "Active" in the devices list
- USB debugging authorization has been granted and confirmed
- Device management icons are accessible and responsive in the left sidebar
- You can access the headset's file system and application management features
