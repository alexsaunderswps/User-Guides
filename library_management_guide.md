# Library Management Guide

## Purpose & Context
This guide provides the required steps to install the WildXR application and remove or hide unwanted VR applications. 
Meta VR headsets automatically install numerous social media apps that may be undesirable in a public setting.

## Important Security Notes

⚠️ **Password Coordination**: Never change passwords without WPS coordination. This prevents technical support lockouts.

⚠️ **2FA Method Choice**: If SMS or Whatsapp was selected as 2FA method WPS will not have access to these messages to assist with account login, device linking, or account recovery.

⚠️ **2FA Device Sharing**: Multiple staff can safely use authenticator apps for same account. Each device gets unique name.

⚠️ **Time Sensitivity**: 2FA codes expire every 30 seconds. Watch countdown timer in authenticator app.

⚠️ **Account Recovery**: WPS maintains master access for account recovery. Don't remove WPS access methods.

## Understanding 2FA Security

**Why 2FA is required:**
- Meta mandates 2FA for most accounts
- Protects against unauthorized access
- Required for enterprise VR deployments

**How codes work:**
- Apps generate time-based codes
- Codes sync with Meta's servers
- Each code valid for 30-second window
- No internet required for code generation

## Next Steps

With Meta account access established:
- Test VR headset connection and pairing
- Verify profile information appears correctly in headset
- Document 2FA setup for other staff members
- Establish backup access procedures with WPS
