## Configuration: Full Three-Tier Cascaded Setup (TP-Link → Opal → ASUS)

The three-tier cascaded configuration represents the most comprehensive networking solution for complex VR deployments, combining long-range connectivity, intermediate processing, and optimized final delivery. This setup addresses scenarios where VR equipment must be deployed in locations with challenging connectivity requirements, such as separate buildings, outdoor areas, or locations with significant physical obstacles.

### Understanding the Three-Tier Architecture

#### The Specialized Role of Each Tier

Think of the three-tier setup as a specialized transportation system, where each stage is optimized for specific challenges:

**Tier 1 (TP-Link CPE):** The long-haul transport layer, designed to capture network connectivity from distant sources or overcome physical obstacles. The CPE excels at long-range, high-gain connections but provides basic routing services.

**Tier 2 (GL.iNet Opal):** The processing and adaptation layer, handling complex network requirements like VPN connections, traffic management, and protocol adaptation. The Opal serves as the "diplomatic interface" between institutional requirements and VR needs.

**Tier 3 (ASUS RT-AX1800S):** The final optimization layer, providing WiFi 6 performance, advanced QoS, and VR-specific network features. This tier focuses entirely on creating the optimal wireless environment for VR applications.

#### When Three-Tier Configuration is Necessary

**Physical Distance Challenges:** When VR equipment must be deployed more than 100 meters from the network source, the CPE provides the long-range connectivity that standard routers cannot achieve.

**Obstacle Navigation:** Buildings, terrain, or other physical obstacles may require high-gain directional antennas to establish reliable connectivity.

**Signal Boosting Requirements:** Weak institutional WiFi signals may need amplification and optimization before being suitable for VR applications.

**Complex Network Requirements:** Some deployments require VPN connections, multiple authentication methods, or complex traffic management that benefits from distributed processing across multiple devices.

### Comprehensive IP Addressing Architecture

The three-tier setup requires careful IP address planning to prevent conflicts while maintaining clear network hierarchy:

**Tier 1 (TP-Link CPE) - 192.168.1.x:**
- **Device IP:** 192.168.1.1
- **DHCP Range:** 192.168.1.100 - 192.168.1.199
- **Purpose:** Provides connectivity from institutional network to Tier 2

**Tier 2 (GL.iNet Opal) - 192.168.2.x:**
- **WAN IP:** 192.168.1.100 (assigned by CPE)
- **LAN IP:** 192.168.2.1
- **DHCP Range:** 192.168.2.100 - 192.168.2.150
- **Purpose:** Intermediate processing and traffic management

**Tier 3 (ASUS Router) - 192.168.10.x:**
- **WAN IP:** 192.168.2.100 (assigned by Opal)
- **LAN IP:** 192.168.10.1
- **VR DHCP Range:** 192.168.10.100 - 192.168.10.200
- **Purpose:** VR-optimized wireless delivery

This addressing scheme ensures clear separation between tiers while preventing IP conflicts that could disrupt network connectivity.

### Why Three-Tier Configuration Excels for Complex VR Deployments

The three-tier cascaded setup addresses the most challenging aspects of institutional VR deployments by distributing different network functions across specialized equipment. This approach provides several critical advantages:

**Distance and Obstacle Management:** The CPE tier handles the physical challenges of connecting to distant or obstructed network sources, providing capabilities that standard routers simply cannot match.

**Institutional Network Complexity:** The Opal tier manages the complex authentication, security, and policy requirements that institutions often impose, while providing the processing power needed for VPN connections and traffic management.

**VR Performance Optimization:** The ASUS tier focuses entirely on creating the optimal wireless environment for VR applications, providing WiFi 6 features and advanced QoS without compromising upstream network requirements.

**Fault Isolation and Maintenance:** The three-tier design makes it much easier to identify and resolve network issues. Problems can be isolated to specific tiers, and individual components can be maintained or upgraded without affecting the entire system.

**Scalability and Future-Proofing:** Each tier can be upgraded independently as requirements change or technology advances. This modular approach protects the investment in network infrastructure while allowing for technology evolution.

The complexity of the three-tier setup is justified by the demanding requirements of professional VR deployments in institutional environments. When properly configured and maintained, this architecture provides enterprise-grade performance and reliability for the most challenging VR networking scenarios.
