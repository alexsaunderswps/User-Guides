   - *If you are an Organization Admin you will only see markers associated with your organization*
   - *If you are a System Admin you will see all markers across all organizations*
   - To **"Add"** a new marker continue to Step 4
   - To **"Edit"** an existing marker, continue to Step 8

### Add a new Custom Map Marker

4. **Name, Description, and Icon**
   - On the **Map Marker Admin** page click the **" + Add Map Marker"** button in the top right
   - In the **"Name"** field, enter the Map Marker name - *This name represents the marker on the globe and will be visible in the WildXR Globe Scene*
   - ⚠️ *When selecting a **Name** for the marker, shorter is better - under 15 characters (including spaces)*
   - In the **"Description"** field enter a brief description of what the map marker contains
   - *The **"Description"** field is for internal reference only and is not visible within the WildXR app*
   - *If you are an **Organization Admin** the **"Organization"** field will be prepopulated with your organization*
   - *If you are a **System Admin** select the appropriate **Organization** from the drop-down menu*
   - Select an **"Icon"** from the drop-down menu - there are 16 choices

5. **Location**
   - In the **"Latitude"** field, enter the latitudinal coordinates 
   - In the **"Longitude"** field, enter the longitudinal coordinates
   - ⚠️*Latitude and Longitude coordinates must be unique for each **Map Marker***
   - *The marker name will display on either side of the marker icon in the WildXR application - depending on its position relative to the viewer*
   - ⚠️*Marker icons and marker names may overlap in the WildXR application if placed too close together*
   - *WPS suggests separating markers by at least 6 degrees of **Latitude**, and if possible by 6 degrees of both **Latitude** and **Longitude** to prevent markers overlapping*
   - ⚠️*WPS recommends reviewing how map markers display and their proximity to one another prior to using them in a public installation*
   - Click the **"Next"** button
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add videos to a map marker

6. **Associating videos with a Map Marker (optional)**
   - *You can add existing video to a **Map Marker** through the marker creation wizard or later during edit*
   - *You can also add videos to a **Map Marker** through the edit video process*
   - Check the box in the upper left corner of each video you want included in the **Map Marker** contents
   - Use the **Search** function to narrow down the videos presented for inclusion
   - Use the **Pagination** interface (page numbers) in the lower right to see more videos and add them to your marker
   - When you have finished adding videos to your marker, click the **"Next"** button
   - *If you are an **Organization Admin** you will only see videos associated with your organization and those by the WildXR team*
   - *If you are a **System Admin** you will see all videos across all organizations*
   - ⚠️*A **System Admin** should not add videos from different organizations to a marker unless that marker is for WildXR team use*
   - ⚠️*Adding videos from different organizations to an organization's **Custom Map Marker** can cause confusion and prevents the owning organization from removing that video during editing*

### Review map marker details

7. **Review & Save**
    - Review the information for your marker
    - Check that the **"Videos"** count matches your expected value
    - If all values are correct click the **"Save"** button

## Troubleshooting

**Unable to log onto the Wildxr.org website:**
- Ensure you are entering the correct credentials to log into Wildxr.org *(May have been supplied by WPS Staff)*
- If someone within your organization created your account; check that they assigned a password to your account *(passwords are not created automatically)*
- Double-check the URL you have entered into your Web Browser *(WPS recommends using Chrome)*

**When saving an error shows that Latitude or Longitude is required:**
- WildXR does not accept a **Latitude** or **Longitude** value of 0 for **Custom Map Markers**.
- Add a small decimal amount if a 0, 0 marker is needed for your organization.

**When saving an error shows that "Another map marker exists at this location":**
- Map Marker coordinates are required to be unique within an organization.
- *This is done to prevent a total overlap of Map Markers*.
- ⚠️*WPS recommends separating markers by at least 6 degrees of **Latitude**, and if possible, 6 degrees of both **Latitude** and **Longitude** to prevent overlap.

**Unable to find and assign video to map marker:**
- Only videos belonging to your **Organization** or those created by **WildXR staff** are available if you are an **Organization Admin** user.
- The WildXR video collection is quite large and it is easy to miss an existing video - use the search function on the **Videos** selection page to narrow your choices.
- If you believe a video should be available to your organization and it is not, contact WPS Staff.

**No Icon represents the contents of my Custom Map Marker:**
- Current **Icon** selection is limited to 16 choices that represent a wide range of video concepts.
- **Icons** are specifically crafted to look good within the WildXR application.
- WPS Staff are not currently crafting custom **Icons** for markers in WildXR.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Map Marker not visible in Installation:**
- **Map Markers** are only visible in the **Globe** scene of WildXR.
- If you are running a **Startup Video** in **Loop Startup Video** mode, no markers will be shown
- **Map Markers** need to be included in a **Video Catalogue** before they can be shown in the WildXR application.
- **Map Markers** in a **Video Catalogue** will only be shown if that catalogue is used in an **Installation**.
- Reach out to WPS Staff if **Map Markers** are not behaving as expected in your system
- *If your device is offline and the videos associated with the invisible map marker are not downloaded, WildXR will hide the marker*

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Map Markers can overlap**: Overlapping Map Markers are difficult for users to interact with. Verify that Map Markers are separated with no overlap before deploying your markers to a publicly used Catalogue or Installation.

⚠️ **Markers without downloaded videos will not show in WildXR when offline**: If a device is offline, map markers will not show if they do not contain any downloaded videos. Reconnect to the internet or sideload the needed videos to have WildXR show the marker in question.

## Verification Steps

Verify that your map marker creation or updates have been successful.

**Complete functionality verification:**
- Log out of the Wildxr.org Web Portal
- Log in and refresh the **Map Markers** page to ensure your marker appears as expected
- Assign your **Custom Map Marker** to a **Video Catalogue** and that **Video Catalogue** to an **Installation**.
- Assign that **Installation** to a registered **Device** and connect that device to the internet. 
- Launch WildXR and confirm that the **Map Marker** and all expected **Videos** appears as expected
- Verify that the marker details appear as expected:
    - Marker title
    - Marker icon
    - Marker position
    - Marker video contents
