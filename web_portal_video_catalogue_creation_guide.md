   - In the top navigation bar, click **"Video Catalogues"**

   - To **"Edit"** an existing catalogue, continue to Step 8

### Add a new video catalogue

4. **Name, Overview, and Organization**
   - On the **Video Catalogues** page click the **"+ Add"** button in the top right
   - In the **"Name"** field, enter the **Video Catalogue** name - *This name is used for organization and assignment on the WildXR web portal only and is not visible to the users*
   - In the **"Overview"** field enter a brief description of the **Video Catalogue**
   - *This **Overview** is used internally for organization and is not shown to the user*
   - *If you are an **Organization Admin** the **"Organization"** field will be prepopulated with your organization*
   - *If you are a **System Admin** select the appropriate **Organization** from the drop-down menu*
   - Click the **"Next"** button

### Add markers to a catalogue

5. **Add core and custom map markers**
   - Select the **"Core Map Markers"** for the catalogue by clicking the appropriate checkboxes
   - **"Core Map Markers"** are curated by WildXR staff and are available to everyone
   - *Use the **"Select All Map Markers"** checkbox to quickly select all **Core Map Markers***
   - ⚠️*Map Marker selection determines which videos are available for your catalogue*
   - ⚠️*If you select no map markers - all videos produced by your organization or WildXR are available for assignment to your catalogue*
   - ⚠️*If you select map markers - only videos produced by your organization or WildXR, **and** associated with the selected markers - are available to be used in the catalogue*
   - Click the **"Custom Map Marker"** tab to show markers associated with your organization
   - Select the markers for the catalogue by clicking the appropriate checkboxes
   - ⚠️*Be mindful of the number of markers selected for a catalogue as too many markers are visually unappealing to users in the WildXR application*
   - ⚠️*Remember that Map Markers can overlap which can make them unresponsive to user interaction - always check your catalogue prior to using it in public facing VR experiences*
   - Click the **"Next"** button

### Associate videos with your catalogue

6. **Add videos**
   - Check the box in the upper left corner of each video you want included in the **Video Catalogue** contents
   - Use the **Search** function to narrow down the videos presented for inclusion
   - Use the **Pagination** interface (page numbers) in the lower right to see more videos and add them to your catalogue
   - *Videos will only show in the **Map Marker** to which they are assigned, or in the **All Clips** and **Short Films** galleries if the **Menu Tray** is visible in your **Installation**
   - ⚠️*A **Video Catalogue** is a snapshot of content when it is created - updates to **Core Map Markers** and **Custom Map Markers** will not update within an existing **Video Catalogue** ⚠️
   - When you have finished adding videos to your catalogue, click the **"Next"** button
   - *If you are an **Organization Admin** you will only see videos associated with your organization and those by the WildXR team*
   - *If you are a **System Admin** you will see all videos across all organizations*
   - ⚠️*A **System Admin** should not add videos from different organizations to a catalogue unless that catalogue is for WildXR team use*
   - ⚠️*Adding videos from different organizations to an organization's **Video Catalogue** can cause confusion and prevents the owning organization from removing that video during editing*

### Review video catalogue details

8. **Review & Save**
    - Review the information for your catalogue
    - Check that the included **Map Markers** are the one you expected
    - Check that the **"Videos"** count matches your expected value
    - If all values are correct click the **"Save"** button
    - If changes need to be made you can click the **"Back"** button
    - *You can also click the radio button above the selection that needs correcting at the top of the page (**Add Video Catalogue** for catalogue details, **Map Markers** for marker selection, and **Videos** for video selection)*

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Unable to generate a WildXR number:**
- Ensure that the WildXR application has been successfully installed on the device
- If you are attempting to launch WildXR on a computer you will need to connect a VR headset to successfully navigate the WildXR app
- Verify that you can see the **gear icon** used to access the **"Settings Menu"** 

**Unable to find WildXR number on the Wildxr.org website:**
- Ensure you have correctly typed the WildXR number into the Device Lookup field on the Wildxr.org website
- If you are currently on the **Devices** page of the Wildxr.org website, navigate away and then back before attempting the Device Lookup
- Refresh your browser window *(WPS recommends using Chrome)*

**WildXR number is already generated for a device:**
- Double check that the device has not already been registered on the WildXR.org website
- If you are re-installing WildXR on a computer, you will need to remove the **Wildlife Protection Solutions** folder from your hard drive
  - *Ensure that **Hidden Items** are visible in your **File Explorer***
  - Open a folder and, under **View** options click **"Show"** and check **"Hidden Items"**
  - On Windows navigate to ```This PC -> C -> Users -> [Your User Name] -> App Data -> Local Low```
  - Delete the **Wildlife Protection Solutions** folder
  - Reinstall the **WildXR** application

**Applied changes to Device not visible in Device**
- Ensure that your device is connected to the internet
- If you have assigned a new **Installation** the device must stop the current session of WildXR and relaunch the WildXR app prior to changes taking effect
- Double check that the Wildxr Number is the one assigned to the headset you are using *(Check the settings menu to confirm the Wildxr number)*

**Unable to edit Device Organization**
- If you are logged into the Wildxr.org website as an **Organization Admin** will not be able to change the device's assigned organization
- Log in as a **System Admin** to enable organization assignment or contact WPS Staff

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Developer Privileges Required**: Your Meta account must have developer access granted by WPS before MQDH will function properly for custom app installation.

⚠️ **Account Consistency**: The Meta account used in MQDH must exactly match the account associated with your VR headsets. Mixed accounts will prevent proper device recognition.

⚠️ **Security Coordination**: Never modify developer settings or install unauthorized applications without WPS approval. This can compromise headset security and void support agreements.

⚠️ **System Requirements**: MQDH requires modern computer specifications and may not work properly on older or resource-limited systems.

## Verification Steps

Verify that your MQDH application is capable of recognizing, connecting to, and managing VR headsets without additional configuration steps.

**Complete functionality verification:**
- MQDH launches without errors and displays account information correctly
- At least one headset appears as "Active" in the devices list
- USB debugging authorization has been granted and confirmed
- Device management icons are accessible and responsive in the left sidebar
- You can access the headset's file system and application management features
